Kafka with python in windows
----------------------


1.In windows
2.Download and extract zookeeper-3.4.14 and kafka_2.12-2.2.0 folders in "C:\Tools" directory
3.Install Kafka and Zookeeper on your machine.
	1)Set Environment variables 
		JRE setup
			-> download and install JRE if not installed.   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html
			-> set Environmental variable
				- Hit New User Variable.
				- Variable name = JAVA_HOME
				- variable value = give JRE path
				- Click ok
				- Hit New System variable
				- Double click path variable
				- Click new
				- Add "%JAVA_HOME%\bin"
				- Click ok
				- To confirm the Java installation, just open cmd and type “java –version.” You should be able to see the version of Java you just installed.
		Zookeeper variable set up
			-> Set Environment variable
				- Hit New system variable
				- Add ZOOKEEPER_HOME = C:\zookeeper-3.4.14 to the System Variables.
				- Double click path variable
				- Click new
				- Add "%ZOOKEEPER_HOME%\bin"
				- Click ok
4.Zookeeper installation
		1. Go to your Zookeeper config directory. For me its C:\zookeeper-3.4.14\conf
		2. Rename file “zoo_sample.cfg” to “zoo.cfg”
		3. Open zoo.cfg in any text editor, like Notepad; I prefer Notepad++.
		4. Find and edit dataDir=/tmp/zookeeper to zookeeper-3.4.14/data  
		5. You can change the default Zookeeper port in zoo.cfg file (Default port 2181).
		6. Double click "zkServer" Windows cmd file inside "C:\Tools\zookeeper-3.4.14\bin" directory to start zookeeper
		
5.Kafka installation
	1. Go to your Kafka config directory. For me its C:\kafka_2.11-2.2.0\config
	2. Edit the file “server.properties.”
	3. Find and edit the line log.dirs=/tmp/kafka-logs” to “C:\\Tools\\kafka_2.12-2.2.0\\kafka-logs"
	4. If your Zookeeper is running on some other machine or cluster you can edit “zookeeper.connect:2181” to your custom IP and port.
     	For this demo, we are using the same machine so there's no need to change. Also the Kafka port and broker.id are configurable in this file. 
		Leave other settings as is.
	5.To start Kafka 
		- Go inside kafka_2.12-2.2.0 directory	
		- open command promt
		- run ".\bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat .\config\server.properties"
4.Don’t forget to start your Zookeeper server and Kafka broker before executing the example code below. 
	In this example we assume that Zookeeper is running default on localhost:2181 and Kafka on localhost:9092.
	
	
5. Now your Kafka Server is up and running, you can create topics to store messages.
6.List down topics.
	C:\Tools\kafka_2.12-2.2.0\bin\windows>kafka-topics.bat --list --zookeeper localhost:2181
7.List down topics
	C:\Tools\kafka_2.12-2.2.0\bin\windows>kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic test
8.Delete Topic
	C:\Tools\kafka_2.12-2.2.0\bin\windows>kafka-topics.bat --list --zookeeper localhost:2181
	but here the topic only marked for deletion
	So got to 'C:\Tools\zookeeper-3.4.14\bin' and run zkCli
	Then a command promt will open
	check whether the topic exist by pasting 'get /brokers/topics/<topic_name>' in there
	remove topic permanently by pasting these 2 commands in cmd
		rmr /brokers/topics/<topic_name>
		rmr /admin/delete_topics/<topic_name>
